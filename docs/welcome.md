## Prerequisites

To get started with the workshop you need to have Administrator Access to an AWS Account. Please do not use the accounts root user since this is bad practice and leads to potential security risks.

We recommend you create a dedicate IAM user following [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html). Make sure, that you are able to login into the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) with your IAM user.
