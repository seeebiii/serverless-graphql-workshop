# Serverless GraphQL API with AppSync and DynamoDB

## Abstract

In the last years, GraphQL has become very popular for frontend to backend communication in the tech industry. GraphQL makes it easy to control all the data you need and thanks to the typed schema GraphQL has great tooling for caching, testing, or orchestrating a microservice architecture. This workshop provides an outlook on the future of API development with Amazon Web Services. With just the AWS console and a small portion of code, we are able to create a serverless and scalable GraphQL API in minutes. If you love to play around with bleeding-edge technologies and want to get your hands dirty in a hands-on session - this workshop is the right one for you!

TL;DR:

* Build a serverless GraphQL API with AWS in minutes
* Integrate the API with a scalable database
* Use functionless technologies, the next evolution of serverless
* Enjoy a hands-on session with bleeding-edge technologies

## What will you learn?

* Setting up AppSync with DynamoDB and VTL
* Wiring up different databases with GraphQL
* Using pipeline resolvers for validation
* Monitoring the API
* X-Ray to trace requests
* Caching with AppSync
* Pagination with GraphQL and DynamoDB

## Out of Scope

* Testing
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Deployment 
* Infrastructure as Code
* Authentication / Authorization

## Prerequisites

To get started with the workshop you need to have Administrator Access to an AWS Account. Please do not use the accounts root user since this is bad practice and leads to potential security risks.

We recommend you create a dedicate IAM user following [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html). Make sure, that you are able to login into the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) with your IAM user.
