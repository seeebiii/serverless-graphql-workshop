GraphQL makes it easy to control all the data you need and thanks to the typed schema GraphQL has great tooling for caching, testing, or orchestrating a microservice architecture. This workshop provides an outlook on the future of API development with Amazon Web Services. With just the AWS console and a small portion of code, we are able to create a serverless and scalable GraphQL API in minutes. If you love to play around with bleeding-edge technologies and want to get your hands dirty in a hands-on session - this workshop is the right one for you!

TL;DR:

* Build a serverless GraphQL API with AWS in minutes
* Integrate the API with a scalable database
* Use functionless technologies, the next evolution of serverless
* Enjoy a hands-on session with bleeding-edge technologies
